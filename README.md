# Introduction

This project is an example of how a call center company can use the data to look at the agent's activity and an account's condition.

There are 2 companies for this project. ABC Company and DFE Company.
All the reports end in 8/14/2023.

Copying the raw data values and pasting them in the appropriate report, keeps it up to date.

Raw data was imported from Talkdesk, Amazon Connect and Salesforce.

## Management Report
This folder contains reports used for management in order to monitor an account.


### _Amazon Connect_
[Case Report - Salesforce](https://github.com/Ziberino/Call-Center-Reporting/tree/main/Management%20Report/AmazonConnect) - is a report showing the open cases, closed cases and pending cases of agents.

[Repeated Calls - Amazon Connect](https://github.com/Ziberino/Call-Center-Reporting/tree/main/Management%20Report/AmazonConnect) - is a report showing how many times a customer called within a specific timeframe.


### _Talkdesk_
[ABC August Management Report](https://github.com/Ziberino/Call-Center-Reporting/tree/main/Management%20Report/Talkdesk)- is a report used to monitor the service level, attendance, emails, chats, agent activity and agent stats.

## Other Reports
This folder contains the break schedules of the agents and the employee table/database for referencing.

[Break Monitoring](https://github.com/Ziberino/Call-Center-Reporting/tree/main/Other%20Reports/Break%20Monitoring)- is a tracker used to monitor an agent's first break, lunch and last break.

[Team Composition](https://github.com/Ziberino/Call-Center-Reporting/tree/main/Other%20Reports/Team%20Composition) - is used as a reference so that all reports have the same reference.

# Final Notes

In the future, I will try to automate everything and use SQL, since Excel uses a ton of space compared to querying and importing it in SQL.
